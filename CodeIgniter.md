# Introduction #

CodeIgniter is an open source web application framework for use in building dynamic web sites with PHP. "Its goal is to enable [developers](developers.md) to develop projects much faster than... writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries.


# History #

Since the company's founding in January 2002, it has released four different applications to the public.
The first, pMachine Pro, is no longer developed, but was weblog software that had both a free and licensed version. pMachine's feature list was similar to other weblog software of the time, such as Movable Type, Geeklog, and LiveJournal. Although pMachine is quite out of date at this point, the last version of pMachine Pro continues to be available free.
The company's flagship software product is ExpressionEngine, which is a more general purpose content management system written in object-oriented PHP and using MySQL for storing data. Licenses are available in three variations: a "Non-Commercial" version for personal and non-profit use, a "Commercial" version, and the cheapest option, a "Freelancer" license intended for small Web firms to be able to run their own sites. The underlying code is identical in all cases, although there are several modules held back from the "Freelancer" version. The company offers a 30-day money back guarantee, but no longer offers a free trial or an online demo for prospective customers. None of the licenses are free at this point.
The third product, CodeIgniter, is an open source rapid application development framework with particular emphasis on a very small footprint.
The company launched a fourth product, MojoMotor, a lightweight alternative to ExpressionEngine in July 2010.
